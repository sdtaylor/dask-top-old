Now setting up a subdomain
==========================
- Set CNAME to alias.zeit.co
- Verify the ownership of the domain by adding a TXT record
- $ now domains ls # for listing all the domains managed by now
- Link to the original tutorial https://zeit.co/docs/v1/getting-started/assign-a-domain-name#4.-using-a-custom-domain-with-a-cname

Now deploying
=============
- now -e <env variables>


Including extra files in the egg package
=======================================
- MANIFEST.in file 
- data_files list in the setup.py file


Building software distribution and wheel package
=================================================
Make sure to update the setuptools and the wheel package to latest one
- Building source distribution

$ python setup.py sdist

- Building wheel package 

$ python setup.py bdist_wheel


Uploading to pypi using twine
=============================
- Twine will upload all the archives under dist
- Update the download url in the setup.py file by creating a github release
- Need to make a ~/.pypirc file for storing credentials https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/941

$ twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*


Inspecting installation packages
=================================
- for data files a folder is created inside the ptop package itself, inspecting wheel package `unzip -l dist/*.whl`
- Somehow the data files getting assembled in wheel package are not getting copied while installing the package into site packages

 ptop-1.0.0.data/data/*

 - Best practice for data files

- egg-info is used for installation from the software distribution tarball in case we cannot install the wheel package

Setup.py hacks 
==============
- Undo python setup.py develop by using -u flag
- Undo python setup.py install

$ python setup.py install --record files.txt
$ cat files.txt | xargs rm -rf
